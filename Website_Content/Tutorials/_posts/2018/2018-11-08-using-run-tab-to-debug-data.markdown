Debugging Data from a RoboteQ Device
---------------

Often when using a RoboteQ motor controller, it is useful to be able to debug real time information about the values that the device is outputting or reading. This can help you figure out what is going wrong with an application, monitor performance, or even be used as field application tool for logging data from the motor controllers. The following tutorial walks you through debugging data from RoboteQ devices using Roborun+.

Using the Run Tab in Roborun+
-------------

Roborun+ comes with powerful tools to debug and log data from the device's operation. These tools can be accessed from the run tab of the configuration utility. For example, here is the run tab from a Roborun+ instance connected to an [MDC2460]:

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-Run-Tab-20181107141633438.png "Run Tab of Roborun+")

From the run tab you can use the capture section to display multiple different kinds of [runtime values](#channel-value-reference). The values what we want to debug are selected by using the channel drop down menus. There are 8 channels in total.

For instance, if we want to run a motor in open loop and check its current draw we should debug the Battery Volts, Motor Command, Motor Power, and Motor Amps:

As you can see the Capture section will report the current value, the maximum value, and the minimum value of the value selected for each channel. The minimum and maximum values can be cleared and set to the current value by clicking on the clear button.

Recording and Graphing Data
----------------------

We can do much more than just inspect the current value of each channel. By hitting the record button we can also log the past values of each channel. This log will display in the graph of the capture section. Here is a graph of a motor on channel one accelerating from 0% duty cycle to 100% duty cycle in open loop mode:

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20181107155911482.png)

You can see that the motor command changes immediately and the motor ramps the supplied voltage to achieve the motor command (the acceleration in this example is quite low). Each value change is logged in the graph section over time.

Saving a Data Log
---------------------

Roborun+ is capable for viewing data logs from the capture section channels. However, manipulating the logs and performing analysis on the log data is beyond the scope of our Roborun+. For this reason, we have included the ability to save a copy the data log to an external, tab delimitted text file. You can do this using the Save button in the capture section:

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20181107162441408.png)

The chart will save as a tab delimited list in a text file. Here is an excerpt from the log generated by the Ramping motor from earlier:

A time stamp for each value is given to document when the sample was taken for each channel value.
