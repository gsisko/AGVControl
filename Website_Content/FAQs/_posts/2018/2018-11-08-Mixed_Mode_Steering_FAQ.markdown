Q: How do I steer with a single joystick on a dual motor controller?
------------

By default, our controllers will control a [differential drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot) in tank mode. Using Mixed mode steering, you can control both the speed and the steering with a single joystick.

Steps to Configure mixed Mode Steering
--------------

* Make sure that you have Mixed Mode steering set in General Drop down menu of the Power Output section in the Configuration tab of Roborun+:

* Make sure you remember to Save the configuration to the controller:
