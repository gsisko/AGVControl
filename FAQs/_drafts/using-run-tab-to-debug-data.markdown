#Q: How do I Debug Data from a RoboteQ device?

All of RoboteQs control utilities come with powerful tools to debug and log data from the devices operation. These tools can often be accessed from the run tab of the configuration utility. For example, here is the run tab from a Roborun+ instance connected to an MDC2460:

From the run tab you can use the capture section to display multiple different kinds of runtime values.
